# PPE Detection Engine

This README provides an overview of the stream_processor component, its purpose, and instructions for setup and usage.

## Overview

The stream_processor is a component of the cloud processes designed to detect personal protective equipment (PPE) in images or video streams using machine learning models. It ensures compliance with safety standards by identifying whether individuals are wearing required PPE such as helmets, vests, gloves, etc.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Processes images or video streams to identify PPE.
- **Customizable Models**: Supports integration with custom-trained models.
- **Scalable**: Designed to work in AWS environments for scalability.
- **Logging and Alerts**: Provides logs and alerts for non-compliance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- AWS CLI configured
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/safesight-ai.git
    cd aws-scripts/ppe-detection-engine
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the detection engine:
    ```bash
    python ppe_detection.py --input /path/to/input --output /path/to/output
    ```

2. Customize detection parameters in the configuration file (`config.json`).
